The basic neural net in the program has the following parameters: for the 7-year market 
(i.e. 2000 examples for learning), it has 600-700 inputs. 
According to the theory of neural networks, the neural net with 600 inputs could be educated at the market 
with price history of more than 20 (sometimes 30) years. Otherwise the neural net will be 'over-educated' 
(it means that the neural net works perfectly within the optimizing interval and does not work at all 
within the testing interval). We created a specialized neural net, and 7 years of history is enough. 
In this case, the total process of learning takes only 3-4 minutes). 
The program allows for setting the amount of hidden neurons; in our opinion, less than 100 is enough

# ********************** Features ************************************
Fixed position sizing
Position sizing based on balance %


# ********************** Lessons Learned *************************************
Model is as good as train data. Model needs to be trained on variety of data

Predict DR for several days => not any better

Do not trust signals if you cannot test them on historical data

Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify.

Trade as soon as signal is produced. Late entry is better than no entry

Short trade SR Calculation should be based on original price.
Daily open/close position is recommended for short trade. Then daily DR can be used for SR calculation

HH/LL Stop Loss is not better than % SL

Historical Results which were used for training cannot be trusted
Only Test Results can be trusted
